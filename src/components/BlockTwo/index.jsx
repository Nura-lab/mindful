                    ZEN cards have a very neat feature that will help you<br/>
                    whenever your electronic devices start failing after the <br/>
                    standard warranty ends, which is pretty common.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When you buy any electronics with your ZEN shopping<br/>
                    MastercardÂ®, their warranty gets extended by one <br/>
                    year. How does it work? It simply does. Automatically.
